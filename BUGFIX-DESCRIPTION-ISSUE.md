# Bug Fixes - Service Worker & Product Descriptions

## Issues Reported

1. **Service Worker Problem**: Had to manually delete service worker to see new content
2. **Missing Descriptions**: All products showing "Keine Beschreibung verfügbar"

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Aggressive Service Worker Caching

**Problem**: The service worker was using cache-first strategy for ALL same-origin requests, including HTML and JavaScript files. This meant:
- Users would see the old app version even after redeployment
- Had to manually clear service worker to see updates
- Poor developer and user experience

**Solution**: Changed to network-first for HTML and JS files (lines 43-55 in `public/sw.js`):

```javascript
// Network-first for HTML and JavaScript to avoid stale app
if (request.destination === 'document' || request.destination === 'script') {
  event.respondWith(
    fetch(request)
      .then((response) => {
        const cache = caches.open(CACHE_NAME);
        cache.then((c) => c.put(request, response.clone()));
        return response;
      })
      .catch(() => caches.match(request))
  );
  return;
}
```

Now:
- ✅ HTML and JS always fetched from network (fresh content)
- ✅ Only falls back to cache if offline
- ✅ CSS, images, fonts still cached (performance)
- ✅ Cache version bumped to v3 (forces old cache cleanup)

### Issue 2: Missing Product Descriptions

**Problem**: The API products might not have descriptions in the fields we were checking. We were only looking for:
- `erleuterungstext`
- `typenAusfuehrungen`

Many products don't populate these fields, or use different field names.

**Solution**: Expanded description field candidates (lines 81-91 in `src/services/gkvApi.js`):

```javascript
const descriptionCandidates = [
  normalizeString(product.beschreibung),           // Direct description
  normalizeString(product.description),            // English variant
  normalizeString(product.erleuterungstext),       // Explanation text
  normalizeString(product.produktbeschreibung),    // Product description
  normalizeString(product.indikation),             // Medical indication
  normalizeString(product.anwendungsgebiet),       // Application area
  normalizeString(Array.isArray(product.typenAusfuehrungen) && product.typenAusfuehrungen.length 
    ? product.typenAusfuehrungen.join(' | ') 
    : null),
].filter(Boolean);
```

**Added Debug Logging** (development only):
```javascript
if (!normalizedProduct.beschreibung && !import.meta.env.PROD) {
  console.log('[gkvApi] Product missing description:', {
    name: cleanName,
    code: cleanCode,
    availableFields: Object.keys(product)
  });
}
```

This will help identify what fields ARE available in the API response.

**Improved Product Card Display** (`src/components/ProductCard.jsx`):
- Now shows `indikation` (medical indication) if no description
- Shows `anwendungsgebiet` (application area) if no description
- Better visual hierarchy when alternative info is displayed

## Files Changed

1. **`public/sw.js`**:
   - Changed to network-first for HTML/JS
   - Bumped cache version to v3
   - Better offline fallback handling

2. **`src/services/gkvApi.js`**:
   - Added 6 more field candidates for descriptions
   - Added development-mode debug logging
   - Better field name coverage

3. **`src/components/ProductCard.jsx`**:
   - Displays indikation/anwendungsgebiet as fallback
   - Conditional rendering based on available data
   - Better information hierarchy

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Service Worker Fix

**Before deploying:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Open in browser, then:
1. Make a small change to any component
2. Rebuild: `npm run build`
3. Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
4. ✅ Should see new content WITHOUT clearing service worker

### 2. Test Product Descriptions

After deploying to Vercel:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. Complete the questionnaire
3. View product results
4. **Check console for**:
   ```
   [gkvApi] Product missing description: { 
     name: "...", 
     code: "...", 
     availableFields: [...] 
   }
   ```

5. **If you see this log**:
   - It means the product has NO description in ANY field we're checking
   - The `availableFields` array shows what fields ARE available
   - Share this with me and I can add more fields

6. **Products should now show**:
   - Description (if available)
   - OR Indikation (if available)
   - OR Anwendungsgebiet (if available)
   - OR nothing (truly no info available)

### 3. Expected Behavior

**Good Scenarios:**
- Product has description → Shows description
- Product has indikation but no description → Shows "Indikation: [text]"
- Product has neither → Shows nothing (no "Keine Beschreibung verfügbar" message)

**Console Logging (Development):**
- Will see logs for products missing descriptions
- Will see available field names
- Use this to identify if API has data in other fields

## Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Test locally first
npm run build
npm run preview

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: service worker caching and product description fields"
git push

# 3. Vercel will auto-deploy

# 4. After deployment, force refresh your browser
# Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

## Questions to Answer After Testing

1. **Do products now show descriptions?**
   - If yes: Great!
   - If no: Check console logs for available fields

2. **Do you still need to clear service worker?**
   - Should be NO now
   - If YES: Let me know, might need more aggressive cache busting

3. **What fields are in the console logs?**
   - Share the `availableFields` array
   - I can add more field mappings if needed

## Why Some Products Have No Descriptions

The GKV API is a government database that aggregates data from manufacturers. Some reasons for missing descriptions:

1. **Data Quality**: Not all manufacturers provide complete data
2. **Product Type**: Some products (like hearing aids) might have technical specs instead of descriptions
3. **Historical Data**: Older products might have incomplete records
4. **Field Variations**: Different manufacturers use different field names

## Next Steps if Still No Descriptions

If after this fix you still see "no description" for most products, please:

1. **Share console logs** showing available fields
2. **Pick 2-3 specific product codes** from your screenshot
3. **I'll investigate** those specific products in the API
4. **We can add** more field candidates or restructure how we display info
