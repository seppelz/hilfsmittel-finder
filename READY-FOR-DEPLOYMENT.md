## ⚠️ Before You Deploy - One Critical Task

### Update Impressum (Required by German Law)

**File**: `src/pages/Impressum.jsx`

**Time Required**: 5 minutes

**What to do**: Replace 6 placeholders with your company information:

1. Company name
2. Street address
3. Postal code and city
4. Legal representative name
5. Phone number
6. Email address

**See**: `LEGAL-PAGES-TODO.md` for detailed instructions with examples

**Why this matters**: German law (§ 5 TMG) requires a complete Impressum. Missing information can result in fines up to €50,000.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (15 minutes)

Once the Impressum is updated:

### Option 1: Quick Deploy with Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: GitHub + Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select your repository
5. Build settings (auto-detected):
   - Framework: Vite
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
6. Click "Deploy"

**Done!** Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes.

## 📋 Post-Deployment Checklist (10 minutes)

Test these on your production URL:

1. Complete the questionnaire
2. View search results
3. Select products
4. Generate and download PDF
5. Test on mobile device
6. Verify Impressum and Datenschutz links work

## 📖 Documentation Available

Everything you need is documented:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `README.md` | Technical overview, setup, API architecture |
| `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` | Comprehensive pre-launch checklist |
| `LEGAL-PAGES-TODO.md` | Impressum update instructions |
| `IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` | What was implemented and how |
| `API-GUIDE.md` | API strategy and troubleshooting |

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

After deployment, monitor:

- **User Engagement**: Completion rate (target: >70%)
- **Performance**: Page load time (target: <3s)
- **Errors**: Error rate (target: <1%)
- **PWA**: Install rate (target: >10%)

Vercel Dashboard will show these metrics automatically.

## 🐛 Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **Test failures**: React 19 compatibility issue with Testing Library (doesn't affect production)
2. **PDF umlauts**: German characters work, but some special symbols may have issues

See `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` for workarounds.
