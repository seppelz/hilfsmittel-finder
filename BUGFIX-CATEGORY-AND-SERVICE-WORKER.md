## 🐛 Bug #1: Category Selection Not Working

### Problem
**User Report**: 
- Selected "Sehhilfen" (vision aids) but got "Badehilfe" (bathroom aid) recommendations
- When going back and selecting "Hörgeräte" (hearing aids), no new search triggered
- Still showed old "Badehilfe" results

### Root Cause
In `HilfsmittelFinder.jsx`, the `handleStart` function was **preserving old answers** when a new category was selected:

```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN) CODE:
setAnswers(prev => ({
  ...prev,  // ❌ This kept ALL old answers from previous category!
  _selectedCategory: selectedCategory
}));
```

**What happened**:
1. User selects "Sehhilfen" → answers vision questions → gets vision products (correctly)
2. User clicks back, selects "Hörgeräte"
3. OLD CODE: Keeps all vision answers + just updates `_selectedCategory`
4. API query builds criteria based on BOTH vision AND bathroom answers (from old state)
5. Results include products from wrong categories
6. Post-filtering might not work if old answers trigger unwanted product groups

### Fix Applied

**File**: `src/components/HilfsmittelFinder.jsx` (Line 58-81)

```javascript
// NEW (FIXED) CODE:
const handleStart = (insurance, pflege, selectedCategory = null) => {
  setInsuranceType(insurance);
  setPflegegrad(pflege);
  
  // ✅ Reset answers and only keep selected category
  // This prevents old answers from previous category selection from persisting
  setAnswers({
    _selectedCategory: selectedCategory
  });
  
  // ✅ Also reset search results to prevent showing old results
  setSearchResults({
    products: [],
    total: 0,
    page: 1,
    pageSize: PAGE_SIZE,
    totalPages: 1,
  });
  setPage(1);
  setSelectedProducts([]);
  
  setStage('questions');
  trackEvent('onboarding_started', { insurance, pflege, category: selectedCategory });
};
```

### What This Fixes

✅ **Fresh Start**: Each category selection starts with a clean slate  
✅ **No Old Answers**: Previous category's answers don't pollute new search  
✅ **No Old Results**: Previous results cleared before new search  
✅ **Correct Filtering**: Only products from the selected category are queried  
✅ **Back Button Works**: User can change categories without stale data  

### Test Scenarios

**Test 1: Basic Category Switch**
1. Select "Hörgeräte" → Answer questions → See ONLY hearing aids ✅
2. Click back → Select "Sehhilfen" → Answer questions → See ONLY vision aids ✅
3. Verify NO hearing aids in vision results ✅

**Test 2: Comprehensive Mode**
1. Select "Vollständige Analyse" → Answer all questions
2. Results should include multiple relevant categories ✅
3. Click back → Select specific category
4. Results should now be filtered to that category only ✅

**Test 3: Multiple Back/Forward**
1. Hearing → Back → Vision → Back → Mobility → Back → Bathroom
2. Each time, results should match the selected category ✅
3. No previous category's products should appear ✅

## 🐛 Bug #2: Service Worker Clone Errors

### Problem
**Browser Console Errors** (repeated many times):
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to execute 'clone' on 'Response': 
Response body is already used
    at sw.js:74:57
    at sw.js:92:81
```

### Root Cause
In `public/sw.js`, the service worker was trying to **clone a Response object after it had been consumed**.

**How Response Streams Work**:
- A `Response` object contains a body stream that can only be read **once**
- Once consumed (e.g., by `cache.put()`, `response.json()`, or returning it), you **can't clone it**
- Must clone **BEFORE** consuming

**OLD (BROKEN) CODE** (Line 73-74):
```javascript
const cache = caches.open(CACHE_NAME);
cache.then((c) => c.put(request, response.clone()));  // ❌ Clone might happen too late
return response;  // ⚠️ Response stream already being consumed
```

**The Problem**:
1. `caches.open()` returns a Promise
2. `.then()` callback executes asynchronously
3. Meanwhile, `return response` starts consuming the stream
4. By the time `.then()` tries to `response.clone()`, the stream is consumed
5. Error: "Response body is already used"

### Fix Applied

**File**: `public/sw.js` (Line 68-85 and 89-105)

#### Fix 1: Network-First Strategy (HTML/JS/CSS)
```javascript
// NEW (FIXED) CODE:
event.respondWith(
  fetch(request, { cache: 'no-cache' })
    .then((response) => {
      // ✅ Clone IMMEDIATELY, BEFORE any async operations
      if (response && response.status === 200) {
        const responseClone = response.clone();  // Clone NOW!
        caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => {
          cache.put(request, responseClone);  // Use clone for caching
        });
      }
      return response;  // Return original response
    })
    .catch(() => {
      console.log(`[SW ${VERSION}] Network failed, using cache for:`, request.url);
      return caches.match(request);
    })
);
```

#### Fix 2: Stale-While-Revalidate (Images/Fonts)
```javascript
// NEW (FIXED) CODE:
event.respondWith(
  caches.match(request).then((cached) => {
    const fetchPromise = fetch(request).then((response) => {
      // ✅ Clone IMMEDIATELY, BEFORE any async operations
      if (response && response.status === 200) {
        const responseClone = response.clone();  // Clone NOW!
        caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => {
          cache.put(request, responseClone);  // Use clone for caching
        });
      }
      return response;  // Return original response
    });
    return cached || fetchPromise;
  })
);
```

#### Version Bump
```javascript
// Force cache refresh with new service worker
const VERSION = 'v4.1';  // ✅ Incremented from v4.0
```

### What This Fixes

✅ **No More Clone Errors**: Response is cloned immediately, before any consumption  
✅ **Proper Caching**: Clone is stored in cache, original is returned to browser  
✅ **Clean Console**: No more errors spamming the browser console  
✅ **Reliable Caching**: Both network-first and stale-while-revalidate work correctly  
✅ **Better Performance**: No failed cache operations  

### Test Scenarios

**Test 1: Load Application**
1. Open app in browser
2. Open DevTools Console
3. Should see **NO** "Failed to execute 'clone'" errors ✅
4. Service worker should install/activate cleanly ✅

**Test 2: Refresh Multiple Times**
1. Refresh page 5 times
2. Console should remain clean ✅
3. Assets should cache properly ✅

**Test 3: Offline Mode**
1. Load app online
2. Go offline (DevTools → Network → Offline)
3. Refresh page
4. App should load from cache ✅
5. No console errors ✅

**Test 4: Service Worker Update**
1. Deploy new version
2. Wait 60 seconds (auto-check)
3. User should see update prompt ✅
4. Accept update → Page reloads with new version ✅
5. Old caches should be deleted ✅

❌ Console flooded with errors  
❌ Confusing and unreliable

### After (Fixed):
✅ Selecting "Sehhilfen" shows ONLY vision aids  
✅ Switching categories triggers new search  
✅ Clean console, no errors  
✅ Reliable and predictable

**User satisfaction**: Expected to increase significantly! 🎉

## Technical Notes

### Why The Bug Was Hard to Spot

**Category Bug**:
- The spread operator `...prev` is common React pattern
- Usually you WANT to preserve previous state
- But for category switching, we need a clean slate
- The bug only manifested when switching between categories

**Service Worker Bug**:
- Response streams are tricky
- Clone timing is non-obvious
- Async operations make it worse
- Error only shows when caching actually happens

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Category Selection**:
   - Always reset dependent state when primary selection changes
   - Don't blindly spread previous state
   - Add comments explaining why state is reset

2. **Service Worker**:
   - Always clone Response BEFORE any async operations
   - Store clone in a variable immediately
   - Never rely on Response being available after a Promise chain

3. **Testing**:
   - Test full user journeys (including back button)
   - Test rapid category switching
   - Monitor browser console in all tests
   - Test offline scenarios

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Deploy to Vercel** - Push to trigger auto-deployment
2. 🧪 **Manual Testing** - Test both scenarios in production
3. 📊 **Monitor Errors** - Check if console errors are gone
4. 👥 **User Feedback** - Confirm category switching works
5. 📝 **Update Docs** - Document the fixes

## Related Issues

- **Post-Filtering** (Previous fix): Prevents irrelevant categories
- **Category Landing Page** (Previous feature): Focused user experience
- **Service Worker Strategy** (Previous fix): Network-first for freshness

All three features work together:
1. User selects category (Landing Page)
2. Answers are reset (This Fix #1)
3. Questions filtered by category (QuestionFlow)
4. API queries only relevant groups (buildApiCriteria)
5. Results filtered by asked categories (Post-Filtering)
6. Fresh content always loaded (This Fix #2 + Network-First)

**Result**: Perfect category targeting! 🎯
